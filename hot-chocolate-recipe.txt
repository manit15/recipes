Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 to 2 tablespoons sugar (depending on how sweet you like it)
- Pinch of salt
- 1 cup milk or any combination of milk, half-and-half, or cream
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions

1. Whisk together the cocoa, sugar, salt, and about 2 tablespoons
   milk in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until cocoa and
   sugar are dissolved. Whisk in the rest of the milk and heat it
   over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until it is hot. Stir
   in the vanilla and serve.

2. If you like it frothy, blend it in the blender.

3. This recipe multiplies easily. When you get up to a quart of
   milk, use 1/4 teaspoon salt.
